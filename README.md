# Goal

An open source implementation/description of the encryption/decryption
algorithm used by Synology NAS products in their Cloud Sync feature, where one
can sync data on the NAS to the likes of Google Drive.

Synology publishes a closed source tool (see below), but I would like to be
know how to decrypt my own data with my own password or private key, in the
(unlikely) event that I lose access to both a NAS of this type and the closed
source tool.

Also, I would like to be able to judge the strength of the encryption.

Official documentation of the encryption algorithm exists, but only on a high
level, and the file format is not documented at all.

I've chosen Python, since I think that allows to to express the algorithm most
clearly.

(Please note that I explicitly do not want to reverse engineer the closed
source 'Synology Cloud Sync Decryption Tool', since I want to avoid doing
things that might be construed to be illegal.)

# Information Sources

There are four pieces of information from Synology, unfortunately spread out
over multiple places which are not easy to find, and not linked together at
all:

 * 'Synology Cloud Sync Decryption Tool', the closed source decryption tool
   (Windows and Linux only, apparently GUI only) which Synology provides.

   It can be obtained through the Synology Support Download Center at
   https://www.synology.com/en-us/support/download/, then choose a NAS that
   offers Cloud Sync (many of them, e.g.,
   [DS110j](https://www.synology.com/en-us/support/download/DS110j)).

   As of this writing the current version is 009.

   (The GUI has a help icon that opens
   https://help.synology.com/enu/utility/SynologyCloudSyncDecryptionTool which
   which contains the same infor as the KB article below.  It also returns
   404 fairly often.)
   
 * Synology Knowledge Base article ["What is Synology Cloud Sync Decryption
   Tool?"](https://www.synology.com/en-global/knowledgebase/DSM/tutorial/Application/What_is_Synology_Cloud_Sync_Decryption_Tool)
   describing how to use the above decryption tool.

 * Page 9 of ["Cloud Sync White Paper -- Based on DSM
   6.0"](https://global.download.synology.com/download/Document/WhitePaper/Synology_Cloud_Sync_White_Paper-Based_on_DSM_6.0.pdf)
([archive.org copy](https://web.archive.org/web/20160606190954/https://global.download.synology.com/download/Document/WhitePaper/Synology_Cloud_Sync_White_Paper-Based_on_DSM_6.0.pdf))
   which I received through Synology Support.

 * The Synology NAS software just lets me check an 'encrypt' checkbox and asks
   for a password, and then sends back a zip-file `key.zip` with files
   `public.pem` and `private.pem`, without any explanation what I can/should do
   with it.

   The above documents make it clear that the files are encrypted individually,
   and that each file can be decrypted using only the password or only
   `private.pem`.
 
Until now, there is only one unofficial source of information:

 - The answers and comments on my StackOverflow question: [What decryption algorithm is
   used here?](http://security.stackexchange.com/q/124838/3617).

# To Do

The current code is still basic and does not provide enough explanation yet.  I'd still like to do the following:

## Core decryption algorithm

* ~~Support new file format 3.0.~~
* ~~Investigate what key2_hash is a hash of.~~
* Warn for any known field that is missing, and for every unknown field.
* Rename `core` to `algorithm`?
* Full documentation of the algorithm in the 'core' module.
* Add algorithm diagram.
* Support `encrypt` = 0 and `compress` = 0 modes.  (It is an error if either of these fields is not specified.)
* Add verification of `@SynologyCloudSync/cloudsync_encrypt.info` file using password and/or private key.
* Investigate how DSM GUI handles non-ASCII passwords.

## Command-line decryption tool

* Decrypt directories recursively.
* Check password file: check single line, warning if not printable ASCII.
* Make log level configurable (default: warning).
* Add `--verify` option, to check decryptability and file structure.
* Make `--verify` option also verify `@SynologyCloudSync/cloudsync_encrypt.info` files.

## Encryption

* Add encryption option/algorithm.
